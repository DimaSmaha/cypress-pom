1. Create and write 10 automation test cases that would verify the basic functionality all over the website
2. Use Page Object Model (POM) to structure the pages, elements, and their methods
3. Create an abstract common.ts file with the methods that should be able to be used on any page
4. Store the static test data in separate files, to call them from the tests
5. Use environment variables to store credentials and sensitive data
6. Upload a solution to Github & Integrate your solution with Github Actions to run tests automatically on each push
